Option B: Sync to GitHub (Recommended for Long-term)

In your Replit project, click the "Version Control" tab
Connect your GitHub account and authorize Replit
Click "Create GitHub repository"
Choose a name and make it private or public
Click "Push" to upload your code
Later, you'll clone this repository to your computer using Cursor.
Part 2: Install and Set Up Cursor

Download Cursor from cursor.sh
Install it like any other application (double-click the installer)
Open Cursor - it looks very similar to VS Code, so it should feel familiar
Part 3: Open Your Project in Cursor

In Cursor, go to File > Open Folder (or press Ctrl/Cmd + O)
Navigate to your unzipped project folder and select it
Your files will appear in the left sidebar
Part 4: Set Up Your Local Environment

This is the biggest difference from Replit - you'll now manage dependencies yourself.
For Node.js/JavaScript Projects:

Open the Terminal in Cursor (View > Terminal or Ctrl/Cmd + J)
Type this command and press Enter:
bash

Copy
npm install
Wait for all packages to download (you'll see a node_modules folder appear)
For Python Projects:

Open the Terminal in Cursor
Create a virtual environment:
bash

Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate it:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Part 5: Transfer Environment Variables

If your Replit project uses secrets/API keys:
In Replit, go to the "Secrets" tab and copy all your keys
In Cursor, create a new file in your project root named .env (note the dot at the start)
Paste your variables in this format:

Copy
API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
Important: Add .env to your .gitignore file if you use GitHub (so you don't accidentally share secrets)
Part 6: Run Your Website Locally

For Node.js:

bash

Copy
npm start
or
bash

Copy
node index.js
For Python:

bash

Copy
python app.py
For Other Frameworks:

Flask: flask run
Django: python manage.py runserver
React/Vite: npm run dev
Your terminal will show a local address like http://localhost:3000 - click it to see your site!
Part 7: Explore Cursor's AI Superpowers

Now for the fun part - Cursor's AI features that go way beyond Replit:
Chat with Your Code: Press Ctrl/Cmd + L to open the AI chat. Ask questions about your entire codebase like "Where do I handle user authentication?"
Edit Code with AI: Highlight any code, press Ctrl/Cmd + K, and type what you want: "Add error handling here" or "Make this function more efficient"
Generate New Files: Right-click in the file explorer and select "New AI File" to create entire components from scratch
Debug with AI: When you get errors, paste them into the AI chat for instant explanations and fixes
Part 8: Optional - Connect to Replit via SSH

If you want to keep using Replit's hosting while coding in Cursor:
Generate an SSH key in Cursor's terminal:
bash

Copy
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "cursor-replit" -f ~/.ssh/replit_cursor
Copy the public key:
Windows: Get-Content ~/.ssh/replit_cursor.pub
Mac/Linux: cat ~/.ssh/replit_cursor.pub
In Replit, go to SSH Keys settings and paste your public key
In Cursor, go to Settings > Advanced > SSH Connections and add your Replit connection details
Troubleshooting Common Issues

"Module not found" errors  : You forgot to run npm install or pip install
"Port already in use"  : Close other terminals or change the port in your code
Environment variables not working: Make sure your .env file is in the project root
Cursor Not Recognizing Python: Install Python from python.org if you haven't already
Next Steps

Once you're comfortable, consider:
Pushing to GitHub: Use Git for version control (File > Initialize Repository)
Deploying your site: Try Vercel, Netlify, or Render for free hosting
Exploring more AI features: Try Cursor's autocomplete (Tab key) and inline edits
You've got this! The first migration is always the hardest, but after 1-2 projects, it'll feel like second nature. Welcome to the world of local development with AI assistance!
